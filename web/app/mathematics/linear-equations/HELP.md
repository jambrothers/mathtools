# Linear Equations Tool

This interactive tool helps students understand linear equations in the form **y = mx + c**.

## Features

- **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to change the gradient ($m$) and y-intercept ($c$).
- **Interaction Modes**: Toggle between different ways to interact with the graph:
  - **Select**: Click to select lines (default).
  - **Move (c)**: Drag a line up/down to change its y-intercept.
  - **Rotate (m)**: Drag a line around its pivot to change its gradient.
- **Visual Aids**: 
  - **Slope Triangle**: Visualizes the rise/run calculation. You can adjust its size or toggle the calculation display.
  - **Intercepts**: Highlights where the line crosses the x and y axes.
  - **Equation**: Displays the formatted equation on the line.
  - **Grid**: Toggle the background grid for easier coordinate reading.
- **Multiple Lines**: Add up to 5 lines to compare different equations.
- **Presets**: Quickly create specific line types:
  - **Parallel**: Create a line with the same gradient ($m$).
  - **Perpendicular**: Create a line with negative reciprocal gradient ($-\frac{1}{m}$).
  - **Proportional**: Set $c=0$ so the line passes through the origin.

## Usage

1. **Changing the Line**: Drag the sliders in the sidebar or use the **Interaction Modes** to modify the equation directly on the graph.
2. **Adding Lines**: Click the "**+ Add**" button in the sidebar to create a new line.
3. **Comparing Lines**: Toggle between lines using the tabs (Line 1, Line 2, etc.) to adjust them individually.
4. **Exporting**: Click "Export" to save your graph as a PNG image or SVG vector file.
