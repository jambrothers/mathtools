# Bar Model Tool

An interactive environment for creating bar models to visualize algebraic relationships, fractions, and proportional reasoning.

## Getting Started

### Adding Bars

There are two ways to add bars to the workspace:
- **Click** a color in the sidebar to add a bar of that color to the center of the screen.
- **Drag** a bar from the sidebar and drop it anywhere on the canvas.

### Selecting Bars

- **Click** a bar to select it (deselects others).
- **Shift+Click** (or Cmd/Ctrl+Click) to add multiple bars to your selection.
- **Drag** on the empty canvas to create a selection box around multiple bars.
- **Click** on the background to clear the selection.

## Manipulating Bars

### Moving and Resizing
- **Drag** selected bars to move them freely. Bars will snap to the grid for alignment.
- **Drag the edge** of a bar (the small handle on the right) to resize it.

### Labeling
- **Click** the text label inside a bar to edit it. You can type numbers, variables (x, y), or text.
- **Quick Label**: Use the sidebar "Quick Label" buttons to instantly apply common labels (a, b, ?, 10, etc.) to all selected bars.
- **Relative Labels**: Toggle "Relative Labels" in the toolbar to automatically label bars based on their width relative to the first selected bar.

## Operations

### Splitting and Joining
- **Split**: Select one or more bars and use the toolbar buttons to split them into:
  - **Halves** (2 equal parts)
  - **Thirds** (3 equal parts)
  - **Fifths** (5 equal parts)
- **Join**: Select two or more adjacent bars and click "Join" to merge them into a single bar.

### Cloning
- **Clone Right**: Create a copy of the selected bars immediately to their right.
- **Clone Down**: Create a copy of the selected bars immediately below them.

### Totals (Braces)
- Select one or more bars and click **Toggle Total** to add or remove a curly brace indicating the total value.
- Click the label on the brace to edit the total value (defaults to "?").

## Toolbar Features

- **Undo**: Revert your last action (Cmd/Ctrl+Z).
- **Clear**: Remove everything from the canvas.
- **Copy Link**: Generate a unique URL to share your current model with students or colleagues.
- **Trash**: Drag bars to the trash icon in the bottom-right corner to delete them (or press Delete/Backspace).

## Tips for Teaching

1. **Part-Whole Models**: Use two rows of bars to show how parts add up to a whole.
2. **Comparison Models**: Place bars side-by-side to visualize differences.
3. **Ratio Problems**: Use the **Clone** feature to quickly build repeating ratio units (e.g., 3 red bars for every 2 blue bars).
4. **Fraction Arithmetic**: Use **Split** to demonstrate finding common denominators.
