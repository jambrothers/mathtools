# Fraction Wall

An interactive tool for exploring equivalent fractions, comparing values, and understanding the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages.

## How to Use

1.  **Build the Wall**: Use the sidebar toggles to choose which fraction families to display (halves, thirds, quarters, etc.).
2.  **Explore Equivalence**: Click on segments to shade them. Visually compare the length of different fractions (e.g., see that 2/4 is the same length as 1/2).
3.  **Change Representations**: Switch between Fraction, Decimal, and Percentage labels to reinforce the connection between these forms.
4.  **Verify**: Turn on "Equivalence Lines" to see vertical guides that highlight perfect alignment between different denominators.

## Controls & Features

### Sidebar Configuration
- **Denominators**: Toggle the visibility of rows from 1/1 to 1/12.
- **Label Mode**: Choose how segments are labeled:
    - **None**: Good for estimation and visual comparison.
    - **Fractions**: Standard notation (e.g., 1/2).
    - **Decimals**: Decimal value (e.g., 0.5).
    - **Percentages**: Percentage value (e.g., 50%).
- **Equivalence Lines**: Toggles vertical guide lines at major intervals (1/2, 1/3, 1/4) to help identify equivalent fractions.
- **Clear All**: Resets all shading.

### Sharing & Export
- **Copy Link**: Generates a URL that captures the exact state of your wall (visible rows, shaded segments, labels) to share with students or save for a lesson.
- **Export Image**: Downloads the current view as a high-quality PNG image for use in worksheets or presentations.

## Teacher Tips

1.  **Introducing Equivalence**: Start with just 1/1, 1/2, and 1/4. Ask students to shade 1/2, then find how many quarters match that length.
2.  **FDP Conversion**: Set up a wall with shading, then toggle between Fraction, Decimal, and Percentage modes to demonstrate that the value remains constant even if the label changes.
3.  **Improper Fractions**: While the wall represents a "whole" (1), you can discuss how multiple rows compare.
