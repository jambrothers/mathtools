# Fraction Wall

An interactive tool for exploring equivalent fractions, comparing values, and visualizing the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages.

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Wall
The Fraction Wall consists of rows representing different denominators (1 to 12).
- The top row represents one whole (1/1).
- Each subsequent row is divided into equal parts corresponding to its denominator (e.g., the 3rd row has three 1/3 segments).

### Shading Segments
- **Click** any segment to shade it.
- **Click again** to unshade it.
- Shaded segments allow you to visually compare quantities across different denominators.

## Display Options (Sidebar)

### Label Modes
Change how the segments are labeled to suit your learning objective:
- **Fraction**: Displays the fraction (e.g., 1/4). Default mode.
- **Decimal**: Displays the decimal equivalent (e.g., 0.25).
- **Percent**: Displays the percentage (e.g., 25%).
- **None**: Hides all labels for estimation or testing exercises.

### Equivalence Lines
- Toggle **Equivalence Lines** to show vertical guides that align with the segments.
- This feature is perfect for identifying equivalent fractions (e.g., seeing that 1/2 lines up perfectly with 2/4, 3/6, etc.).

### Visible Rows
- Use the number grid in the sidebar to show or hide specific denominators.
- For example, you can hide everything except 1, 2, 4, and 8 to focus on the "halving" family.

## Actions

- **Clear Shading**: Instantly unshade all segments on the wall.
- **Copy Shareable Link**: Generate a unique URL that preserves your current configuration (visible rows, shading, label mode). Great for setting up a problem for students to solve.
- **Export Wall**: Download the current view as an image for use in worksheets or presentations.

## Teacher Tips

1.  **Equivalent Fractions**: Ask students to shade 1/2, then find all other segments that line up with it. Turn on "Equivalence Lines" to verify.
2.  **Comparing Fractions**: Shade 1/3 and 1/4. Which is larger? The visual representation helps overcome the misconception that a larger denominator means a larger fraction.
3.  **FDP Conversion**: Start with Fraction labels, then switch to Decimal or Percent to show the relationship between these forms.
4.  **Custom Walls**: Hide irrelevant rows (e.g., 7ths, 11ths) to simplify the view for younger students.
