# Algebra Tiles

An interactive virtual manipulative for exploring algebraic expressions, factoring, and equation solving using colored tiles.

## Getting Started

### Tile Types

The sidebar contains different types of tiles:

**Unit Tiles (1×1)**
- **Yellow (+1)**: Represents positive one
- **Red (-1)**: Represents negative one

**X Tiles (1×variable length)**
- **Green (+x)**: Represents positive x
- **Red (-x)**: Represents negative x

**X² Tiles (variable×variable)**
- **Blue (+x²)**: Represents positive x squared
- **Red (-x²)**: Represents negative x squared

**Y Tiles** (toggle "Show Y" to reveal)
- **Green (+y)**: Represents positive y
- **Red (-y)**: Represents negative y

**XY Tiles**
- **Purple (+xy)**: Represents positive xy
- **Red (-xy)**: Represents negative xy

## Adding Tiles

There are multiple ways to add tiles:

- **Click** a tile in the sidebar to add it to the canvas
- **Drag** a tile from the sidebar and drop it anywhere on the canvas
- **Visualize**: Type an expression like `2x + 1 - y + x^2` in the toolbar input and click "Visualise"

## Interacting with Tiles

### Selecting Tiles

- **Click** a tile to select it (deselects others)
- **Shift+Click** to add to selection
- **Drag** on empty canvas to marquee select multiple tiles

### Moving Tiles

- **Drag** selected tiles to reposition them
- Enable **Snap** in the toolbar for grid-aligned positioning

### Transforming Tiles

- Press **R** to rotate selected tiles 90°
- Press **F** to flip selected tiles (changes sign)
- **Double-click** a tile to flip it

### Deleting Tiles

- Press **Delete** or **Backspace** to remove selected tiles
- Drag tiles to the **trash zone** (bottom-right corner)

## Toolbar Features

### View Options

- **Labels**: Show/hide the value labels on tiles (+1, x, etc.)
- **Show Y**: Toggle visibility of Y-variable tiles in the sidebar
- **Snap**: Enable grid snapping for precise tile placement

### Operations

- **Undo**: Undo the last action (also Cmd/Ctrl+Z)
- **Group**: Arrange tiles in organized groups by type
- **Simplify**: Automatically cancel zero pairs (e.g., +x and -x)

### Other Actions

- **Clear**: Remove all tiles from the canvas
- **Link**: Generate a shareable URL preserving the current state

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| R | Rotate selected tiles |
| F | Flip selected tiles |
| Delete/Backspace | Remove selected tiles |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Z | Undo |

## Tips for Teaching

1. Use the **Visualize** input to quickly set up expressions for students
2. Enable **Snap** for cleaner arrangements when teaching factoring
3. Use **Simplify** to demonstrate combining like terms
4. Share problem setups with students using the **Link** button
5. Show/hide **Labels** to scaffold or challenge students
