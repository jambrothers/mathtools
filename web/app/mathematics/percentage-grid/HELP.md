# Percentage Grid

An interactive grid for exploring the relationship between percentages, fractions, and decimals using a visual model.

## Getting Started

The tool displays a grid of cells where you can shade regions to represent values. As you shade cells, the tool can calculate and display the corresponding percentage, decimal, and fraction.

## Grid Configuration

You can change the grid structure using the "Grid" dropdown in the toolbar:

- **10 × 10 (100 cells)**: Each cell represents 1%.
- **10 × 5 (50 cells)**: Each cell represents 2%.
- **10 × 2 (20 cells)**: Each cell represents 5%.
- **10 × 1 (10 cells)**: Each cell represents 10%.

## Interaction

### Painting and Erasing

- **Click** a cell to toggle it (shade or unshade).
- **Drag** across multiple cells to "paint" them (select them).
- **Drag** across already selected cells to "erase" them (deselect them).

The tool supports rectangular marquee selection, making it easy to fill rows or columns quickly.

## Toolbar Features

### Quick Fills

- **Fill 10%**: Automatically shades 10% of the grid.
- **Fill 25%**: Automatically shades 25% of the grid.
- **Fill 50%**: Automatically shades 50% of the grid.
- **Clear**: Removes all shading from the grid.

### Display Options

You can toggle the visibility of different values in the bottom panel:

- **Panel**: Show or hide the entire value panel.
- **Percentage**: Show/hide the percentage value (e.g., "25%").
- **Decimal**: Show/hide the decimal value (e.g., "0.25").
- **Fraction**: Show/hide the fraction value (e.g., "25/100").
- **Simplify**: Toggle between raw fractions (e.g., "25/100") and simplified fractions (e.g., "1/4").

### Sharing

- **Copy Link**: Generates a URL that preserves the current grid state and display settings, perfect for sharing specific problems or examples with students.

## Teaching Ideas

1. **Equivalence**: Turn on all display modes to show how the same value can be represented in three ways.
2. **Simplification**: Start with a raw fraction (e.g., 50/100) and ask students to predict the simplified form before clicking "Simplify".
3. **Estimation**: Hide the "Percentage" display, shade a random area, and ask students to estimate the percentage.
4. **Grid Bases**: Switch to "10x5" mode to challenge students who are used to working only with "out of 100".
