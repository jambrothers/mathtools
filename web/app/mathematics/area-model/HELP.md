# Area Model Tool

The Area Model tool helps students visualize multiplication of integers and the expansion of algebraic expressions.

## Getting Started

1. **Enter Factors**: Type your factors into the **Factor A** and **Factor B** inputs.
   - For numeric models: e.g., `12`, `25`, `3, 4` (explicitly partitioned).
   - For algebraic models: e.g., `x + 2`, `2x + 1`, `x, 3`.
2. **Visualise**: Click the **Visualise** button to generate the model.
3. **Partitioning**: 
   - Use the **Auto-Partition** toggle to automatically split numbers into tens and units (e.g., `23` becomes `20, 3`).
   - Manually partition factors by separating terms with commas (e.g., `10, 5, 2`).

## Features

- **Progressive Reveal**: Click on individual cells in the area model to reveal or hide their partial products. Use the **Reveal All** and **Hide All** buttons for batch actions.
- **Discrete Array**: For small numeric models, toggle the **Discrete Array** to show individual units within the area.
- **Toggles**: Use the toolbar to show or hide:
  - **Factor Labels**: The terms outside the model.
  - **Partial Products**: The results inside each cell.
  - **Total**: The final sum of all partial products.
  - **Grid Lines**: The partitioning lines within the model.

## Arithmetic Examples

- `12 × 13`: Set Factor A to `12` and Factor B to `13`. With **Auto-Partition** ON, you'll see a 2x2 grid representing `(10+2) × (10+3)`.
- `3 × (10 + 4)`: Set Factor A to `3` and Factor B to `10, 4`.

## Algebra Examples

- `(x + 2)(x + 3)`: Set Factor A to `x + 2` and Factor B to `x + 3`.
- `2x(x + 5)`: Set Factor A to `2x` and Factor B to `x, 5`.

## Exporting & Sharing

- **Generate Link**: Copies a URL to your clipboard that saves all your current factors, toggles, and revealed cells.
- **Export**: Save your current model as a **PNG** image for presentations or an **SVG** file for further editing.
