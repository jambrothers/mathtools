# Double-Sided Counters

An interactive manipulative for exploring positive and negative numbers, zero pairs, and integer arithmetic.

## Getting Started

### Adding Counters

There are several ways to add counters to the board:

- **Sidebar**: Click the **Add +1** or **Add -1** buttons in the sidebar
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag counters from the sidebar onto the canvas
- **Zero Pair**: Click the **Zero Pair** button to add one positive (+1) and one negative (-1) counter simultaneously
- **Expression Input**: Type an expression like `5 + -3` in the toolbar input and press Enter

### Counter Types

Use the dropdown in the toolbar to switch between:

- **+1/-1**: Standard numeric counters (default)
- **Variable Counters**: x, y, z, a, b, c for algebraic exploration

## Interacting with Counters

### Moving Counters

- **Drag** any counter to reposition it on the canvas

### Flipping Counters

- **Double-click** a counter to flip it between positive and negative

### Removing Counters

- **Click** once on a counter to remove it from the board

## Toolbar Features

### View Toggles

- **Number Line**: Show/hide a number line at the bottom displaying the current sum
- **Stats**: Show/hide the statistics panel showing positive count, negative count, and total

### Organizing Counters

- **Sort**: Organizes counters into neat rows, with positives at the top and negatives below
- **Flip All**: Flips every counter on the board simultaneously

### Zero Pair Operations

- **Cancel Pairs**: Automatically finds and removes matching pairs of positive and negative counters (zero pairs)
- **Slow Mode**: Enable step-by-step animation to see each pair being cancelled individually

### Other Actions

- **Clear**: Remove all counters from the board
- **Link**: Generate a shareable URL that preserves the current state

## Tips for Teaching

1. Start with concrete examples using small numbers
2. Use the **Zero Pair** button to demonstrate that +1 and -1 together equal zero
3. Enable **Sort** to visually organize counters before cancelling
4. Use **Slow Mode** to walk through the cancellation process step by step
5. Share states with students using the **Link** button
