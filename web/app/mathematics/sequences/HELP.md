# Sequences Tool

An interactive environment for exploring arithmetic, geometric, and quadratic sequences.

## Getting Started

Use the tool to generate sequences and challenge students to identify the pattern, find the next term, or derive the general rule.

## Core Features

### 1. Sequence Types
- **Arithmetic**: A sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant (e.g., 2, 5, 8, 11).
- **Geometric**: A sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio (e.g., 3, 6, 12, 24).
- **Quadratic**: A sequence where the second differences are constant (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16).

### 2. Random Generation
Click the **Random** button to generate a new sequence. You can use the dropdown to specify which types of sequences should be generated.

### 3. Progressive Exposition
- **Toggle Hidden**: Use the eye button in the toolbar to hide or reveal all terms at once.
- **Reveal One by One**: Click any hidden term (marked with a "?") to reveal it individually.
- **Add Next Term**: Click the **Next ▶** button to calculate and add the next term in the sequence (up to 12 terms).

### 4. Configuration Panel
Click the **Config** button to show/hide the sequence parameters. This allows you to set the first term (`a`), common difference (`d`), or ratio (`r`) manually.

### 5. Visual Representation
- **Counters**: Toggle the "Counters" button to see terms represented visually as dots.
- **Decimal Precision**: The tool supports decimal terms, representing them as partial dots (to 0.1 precision).
- **Negative Values**: Positive terms use **yellow** counters; negative terms use **red** counters.

## Teaching Ideas

1. **Spot the Pattern**: Hide the configuration and generate a random sequence. Reveal the first three terms and ask students to predict the fourth.
2. **Formula Finder**: Toggle on the **nᵗʰ Term** display after students have tried to derive the formula themselves.
3. **Difference Tables**: For quadratic sequences, have students calculate the first and second differences on paper and verify them against the configuration panel values.
4. **Decimals & Ratios**: Explore geometric sequences with ratios between 0 and 1 (e.g., $r = 0.5$) to see how sequences can decrease.
