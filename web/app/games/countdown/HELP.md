# Countdown Numbers Game

A classroom game inspired by the TV show *Countdown*. Students combine six numbers using basic arithmetic to reach a randomly generated target number.

## How to Play

1. **Pick Numbers**: Choose how many 'large' numbers (25, 50, 75, or 100) and 'small' numbers (1-10) to use via the sidebar. 
2. **Generate Puzzle**: Click **New Puzzle** to draw your tiles and a target number.
3. **Set the Clock**: Use the analog clock controls to start a 30-second countdown.
4. **Calculate**: Students must use each of the six numbers at most once, combining them with enabled operations (`+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`, and indices `xⁿ`) to reach the target exactly, or as close as possible.
5. **Reveal Solution**: Click **Reveal Solution** to show a valid step-by-step path to the target found by the solver.

## Controls & Customization

### Configuration (Sidebar)
- **Allowed Operations**: Precisely control which mathematical operators are permitted. Differentiate for your class by disabling division or indices for younger students, or enabling them for a challenge.
- **Large Numbers**: Choose between 0 and 4 large numbers in each draw. 
- **Target Range**: Adjust the minimum and maximum possible target values.
- **Presets**: Quickly switch between Foundation (basic addition/subtraction), Standard (classic rules), and Advanced (extended ranges and indices) modes.
- **Copy Game Link**: Generate a shareable URL that preserves your current configuration and the specific puzzle shown — perfect for lesson planning.

### Game Canvas
- **Analog Clock**: Hover over the clock to access **Start** and **Reset** controls.
- **Reveal Solution**: Displays the calculated solution. If the target is unreachable exactly, the solver will show the closest possible result.

## Teacher Tips

1. **Scaffolding**: Start with the **Foundation** preset to build confidence with basic number bonds before introducing multiplication and division.
2. **Challenge Levels**: Use the **Advanced** preset for higher-attaining students to introduce the order of operations and indices in a competitive context.
3. **Mental Strategy**: Encourage students to explain *how* they reached their answer. Comparing their methods to the computer's generated solution can spark discussion about efficiency and different approaches.
4. **Save Your Favorites**: If you find a particularly elegant or tricky puzzle, save the URL using the **Copy Game Link** button to use it across multiple classes.
