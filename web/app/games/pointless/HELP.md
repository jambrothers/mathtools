# Pointless Game

A classroom game inspired by the TV show *Pointless*. Students strive for the most obscure correct answers to mathematical questions.

## How to Play

1. **Pick a Category**: Select a mathematical topic from the sidebar (Factors, Multiples, Primes, etc.).
2. **Set Parameters**: Adjust the numbers (e.g., Target Number, Max Value) to match your lesson focus.
3. **Ask the Class**: Present the question to the students. They should aim to find a correct answer that no one else in the class provides.
4. **Reveal Answers**: Once all students have guessed, click **Reveal Answers** to see the full set of correct possibilities.
5. **Score**: Students who provided a correct answer that was *not* matched by anyone else win the round (or follow your preferred classroom scoring system).

## Controls & Features

### Configuration (Sidebar)
- **Category Picker**: Switch between different mathematical problem types.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Precisely control the range and values of the questions generated.
- **Copy Game Link**: Generate a shareable URL that preserves your current category and number settings — perfect for sharing with colleagues or saving for a later lesson.

### Game Canvas (Main View)
- **Timer**: Located in the top-left pill. Click to start, stop, or reset. Use the preset durations (1m, 2m, 5m) for quick setups.
- **Next Question**: Generates a new problem using your current sidebar configuration.
- **Reveal Answers**: Toggles the display of all valid answers, sorted for easy reading.

## Teacher Tips

1. **Deterministic Mode**: Since the teacher controls the parameters, you can ensure the difficulty is appropriate for your specific class.
2. **Timed Challenges**: Use the built-in timer to add a layer of competitive pressure and manage lesson pacing.
3. **Save Your Setup**: If you find a particularly good set of parameters (e.g., "Factors of 144" vs "Factors of 150"), use the **Copy Game Link** button to save it to your lesson plan.
4. **Discussion Points**: When revealing answers, discuss the mathematical properties that make some answers easier to find (like small factors) versus more obscure ones (large primes).
